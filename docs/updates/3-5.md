# Update Steps to Version 3.5

Version 3.5 is a Major Update which updates all required Python Modules and also 
resolves older problems which can't be resolved staying compatible. So your help is needed for this one. 

## 1) requirements.txt
The Requirements txt is now divided in 3 Files.

- requirements.txt → All you need to run the Syncer
- requirements-extras.txt → Modules like ldap/ mysql which not all users need
- requirements-ansible.txt → Everything needed for the Ansible automations

Note: If you're using Docker, all Modules are installed automatically.

## 2) Module Updates
Due to Security problems in some of the Modules,  we had to upgrade all Modules of the Framework. So after Update of the Syncers code, you need to run the pip install -r requirements.txt again. Nothing more to-do.

## 3) Inventory Prefix
In the past, inventory values were prefixed like name_ something.
This is now changed to name/. The Problem with the old approach:
cmk_ vs cmk_svc_. If you now want to clean the cache, and delete everting starting with cmk_,
you will also delete the namespace cmk_svc.

Steps for the migration:
- Delete current Inventory: ./cmdbsyncer sys delete_inventory
- Run your inventories again
- Update your rules (Sorry)
