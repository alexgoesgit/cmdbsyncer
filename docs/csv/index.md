# Functions with CSV Files

CSV Options are CLI only and can be access with _./cmdbsyncer csv_

In the following list, you find the possible Endpoints and their Parameters.
Don't get confused to see function names like import_host(...). This is only because of the auto-generated documentation, direct from the source code.

The Names of the functions are equal to the CLI Parameter. Example:
```
./cmdbsyncer csv import_hosts ....
```


::: application.plugins.csv
    options:
      show_source: false
